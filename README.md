## Features

- Utilizes [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) to interact with your database.
- Menu is handled via ox_lib's [interface](https://overextended.dev/ox_lib/Modules/Interface/Client/context) module, which has replaced the old React + Mantine interface.
- Supports logging via Discord.
- Administrators have the ability to manage and oversee vehicles via command.
